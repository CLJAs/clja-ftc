HI, my name is Juan Carlos Caso Alonso.

The repository clja-ftc is an special case of Constructions LJA, that are abstract data structures that lets you "create" , "bijections" and "relations that are not 'functions', that helps you to proof that many many sets that today are thinked to have a cardinality bigger than Alef_null, really don't have a cardinality bigger than N.
